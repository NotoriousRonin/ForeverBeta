# Forever Beta
This is an endless 2D Sidescroller Jump'n'Run. The goal is simply to be the very best on the highscore rank by collecting "Bugs"
while avoiding to fall down or to touch enemies and traps. Move through the levels with WASD/Arrowkeys. Double jumping is possible.
We named this project "Forever Beta" because this is not a "final" game. There are still a lot of things that have to be fixed,
that can be added, made better, more efficient etc. Hope you guys enjoy the mini game. 

This project was made in the summer of 2018 by two students as part of their studies. 
It was made using Photoshop, Audacity and the Unreal Engine (only Blueprints).
